Update for tonight's work, I merged my work from my repo that I started the project on and resolved the last bug that I was unable to fix. Now my code is compiling and executing but the correct output on the webpage is very different from the output that I am getting. I messaged Huanyi about it on Piazza. 

Update for 5/26: I made no edits to my code, I was unable to do my final push to GitHub today because there was a storm that knocked out the power in my house and I had to drive over to my grandmother's house where there was a Wi-Fi connection. The only changes to my project have been that I edited the makefile to allow for the compilation and execution of web_page_test.cpp, renamed the files to match what they are called on the professor's website, and added to the outputs of the tests to their respective .txt files. I know of no bugs or errors in my code as the output from executing web_page_test.cpp matches the output on the website and executing test_Array.cpp passes all the asserts.
